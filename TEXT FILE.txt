Let's outline the steps for creating a "Space Exploration Simulation" website, keeping in mind the provided image's instructions for repository setup and Figma prototyping.

Task 1: Creating a GIT Repository and Setting up Folders

* Repository Creation:

* Go to your Git platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

* Click "New Repository".

* Name the repository with your enrollment number (as instructed in the image). For example, if your enrollment number is "SES123", the repository would be named "SES123".

* Choose visibility (Public or Private).

* Click "Create Repository".

* Folder Creation:

* Option 1 (Local Clone):

* Clone the repository to your computer: git clone [repository URL]

* Inside the cloned directory, create two folders: "Assignment_1" and "Assignment_2".

* Option 2 (Platform Interface):

* Go to your repository on the Git platform's website.

* Use the platform's interface to create the "Assignment_1" and "Assignment_2" folders directly within the repository.

* Word File Creation:

* Create a Word document.

* Document each step of Task 1 (replace with your actual actions):

**Task 1: GIT Repository and Folder Setup**


1. Repository Creation:

- Went to [Git Platform URL].

- Clicked "New Repository".

- Repository name: SES123 (My Enrollment Number).

- Visibility: Private.

- Clicked "Create Repository".


2. Folder Creation:

- Used Option 1 (Local Clone):

- Cloned repo: `git clone [repository URL]`

- Created "Assignment_1" and "Assignment_2" folders.


3. Word File Creation:

- Created this Word document.


* Assignment Upload:

* Save the Word document as a PDF (.pdf) – generally preferred – or as a .docx file.

* Place the file inside the "Assignment_1" folder in your Git repository.

* Repository Link Submission:

* Copy your Git repository URL.

* Paste the URL into the provided Google Form.

Task 2: Preparing a Prototype Design in Figma

Project: Space Exploration Simulation

* Website Screen Planning (8-10 screens minimum):

* Homepage: Introduction to the simulation, featured missions, call to action ("Start Exploring").

* Mission Selection: List of available space missions (e.g., Moon landing, Mars rover, ISS expedition).

* Celestial Body Selection: List of planets, moons, asteroids, etc., to explore.

* Mission Briefing: Details about the selected mission, objectives, and background information.

* Simulation Interface: The main simulation screen with controls for spacecraft, camera views, and interactive elements.

* Spacecraft Controls: Interface for controlling the spacecraft (e.g., thrusters, navigation, scientific instruments).

* Data Display: Real-time data from the simulation (e.g., speed, altitude, fuel, scientific readings).

* Mission Log: Record of the mission's progress and key events.

* User Profile: Profile page for registered users, showing their progress and achievements.

* Help/Tutorial: Instructions on how to use the simulation.

* Figma Prototype Design:

* Use Figma to design each of the screens listed above.

* Add text, images (use placeholder images), icons, and other design elements.

* Design the user flow: How will users select missions, navigate the simulation, and access information?

* Focus on the Simulation Interface and Spacecraft Controls screens. These are the core interactive elements. Make them intuitive and engaging.

* Use Figma's prototyping features to link screens and simulate interactivity. Add interactions like clicks, transitions, and hover effects.

* Screen Design Upload:

* Export Figma designs as PNG, JPEG, or PDF files.

* Place the files inside the "Assignment_1" folder in your Git repository. A subfolder like "Figma_Designs" is recommended.

Key Points:

* Immersive Experience: The design should aim to create an immersive and engaging space exploration experience.

* Realistic Controls: The simulation controls should be intuitive and reflect real-world spacecraft operations.

* Educational Content: Include educational information about space exploration, celestial bodies, and physics.

* Organization: Keep your Git repository organized, especially the "Assignment_1" folder.

* Documentation: The Word file is essential. Document every step you take.

Remember to commit and push your changes to your Git repository regularly. This ensures you have backups and allows you to submit your project.
